**In this `california_housing` data set project I will be implementing a solution for a regression problem using various ML techniques**

* The target variable is the `median house value` for California districts,
expressed in hundreds of thousands of dollars ($100,000). So, I'm tring to create a prediction engine that will predict the median house price for a district based on its features.

* This dataset was obtained from the StatLib repository.
